# Try Everything Portfolio

This project is a portfolio for Sarah Stelljes.

## Description
- The motivation for this project was to test out React. 
- The reason why I made it a portfolio over anything else is because I need a better portfolio. 
- The problem it solved was to prevent repeatitive code. 
- While working with this project, I learned how to use React on the front end part.
